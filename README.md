# Data-Scientist-Assignment
Here I have solved 2 given assignments.  Part 1: Excel; Part 2: Python.
                                                                                                                                       For Excel Assignment, I've added an additional sheet named 'TopIncomes' in order to Filter the Excel Data of sheet1 to a different Worksheet.
In this newly added sheet,I only want those gender and aged group whose income is greater than 50,000. Back on the sheet1, I've added a new column named INCOME, which is greater than 50,000.
After completing the process, we can see that  those top income values of sheet1 have been copied automatically to the new worksheet using an Advanced Filter.




For Python Assignment,used colab to do this task. The following built in library of Colab has been used so no need to install any additional libraries.

import numpy as np ...
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt...
import pandas as pd ...

For K-means clustering, implemeted elbow method to find out the optimal value of K.
