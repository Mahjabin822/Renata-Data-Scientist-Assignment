# Renata-Data-Scientist-Assignment
Here I have solved 2 given assignments.  Part 1: Excel; Part 2: Python
For Excel Assignment, I've added an additional sheet named 'TopIncomes' in order to Filter Excel Data to Different Worksheet.
In this newly added sheet,I only want those gender and aged group whose income is greater than 1500. Back on the sheet1, I've started a criteria area there. I'm using the term 'TopIncomes', which is the criteria heading, and below that I'm going to enter my criterion, which is greater than 1500.
To start the filter on the ribbon, I'll go to the Data tab and click Advanced. In the Advanced Filter dialog, I'm going to select Copy to Another Location. The List range is my main table. So, I'll click here, then go to the sheet1 and select the entire table, including the headings. That's entered as the list range. My Criteria range, I'll click in that cell. Go back to the  sheet1  where I created my criteria range and select the heading cell and the criteria cell below that. For CopyTo, this is where I want the data to end up. I'll click here and select my two heading cells on the TopIncomes sheet and I'll click OK, and there are the values where the income is higher than 1500. If we look back, we can see that  those top income values of sheet1 have been copied automatically to the new worksheet using an Advanced Filter.
